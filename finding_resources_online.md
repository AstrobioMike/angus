# Finding Resources online

## Biological Databases

There are many sources available for acquiring biological data. A partial, and by no means exhaustive, list includes:

+ NCBI
+ Genbank
+ RefSeq
+ Ensembl
+ Microbial Genome Database
+ DDBJ
+ FungiDB

Note that many of these databases cross-reference one-another, with the same depositions found in multiple sources.

## NCBI

+ [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/) - NCBI maintains one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of fully assembled genomes. 

The Taxonomy Browser displays a hierarchical view of the taxonomy, as well as more detailed taxon-specific pages that highlight the internal links to other Entrez databases, the LinkOut links to external resources and other taxon-specific data.

1. Go to [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) page and search for "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

2. Click on `Genome` to display links to download genome, sequence, annotation files for yeast

## Ensemble

Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species.


1. Open [Ensemble](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html?redirect=no) webpage and search for "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

2. Under the "Gene Annotation" section you can download FASTA files for genes, cDNA, ncRNA, proteins and annotations for the same

## NCBI SRA

NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) stores sequence and quality data (fastq files) in aligned or unaligned formats from NextGen sequencing platforms.

1. Open [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) page and search for "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"
![](/static/sra1.png)

2. click on any of the listed results to show project information
![](/static/sra2.png)

3. Under "Project Data" click on links to "SRA Experiments"
![](/static/sra3.png)

4. In, this page, you can find:
    + Experiment Design
    + Sample Information
    + **Library Preparation Information**
    + Sequencing "Run" information with number usually starting with "SRR"
